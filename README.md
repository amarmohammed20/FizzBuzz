# FizzBuzz
Just a simple repo that intends to help other developers in the javascript task called Fizz Buzz.

# Get Started
To get started pull down the code and run the HTML file, it should all make sense. I have also placed comments in the JS file

# Improvements
We could look at better javascript ways to achieve the same goal. Also styling could be hugely improved.
