                <h1>The FIZZ BUZZ Challange</h1>
                <h2>The Task</h2>
                <p style="color: red;">Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".</p>

                <p>I was given a challange from a company I was interviewing with and thought to share it for anyone it could maybe help. This at the face of it seems to be a simple javascript task, we will soon find out.</p>

                <p>Steps taken to in completing this task:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Break down the question, it seems the question is asking two things.</li>
                    <li>The first ask is print the numbers 1 to 100 and while doing so look at three conditions</li>
                    <li>The second ask is consider three conditions which are replace multiples of the number three with "Fizz", replace multiples of the number five with "Buzz" and finally replace multiples of the numbers three and five with "FizzBuzz"</li>
                    <li>I started of with an easy win to get a for loop to console.log the numbers from 1 to 100</li>
                    <li>I than look to set the conditions to replace the multiples of three and five.</li>
                    <li>I than added the results to a global variable which I intended to print to the HTML page</li>
                    <li>I created a button that when selected inserted the result into a div in the HTML</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This option is using a simplt for loop with some if conditions</p>
