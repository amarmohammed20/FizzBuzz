                <h1>The FIZZ BUZZ Challange</h1>
                <h2>The Task</h2>
                <p style="color: red;">Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".</p>

                <p>I was given the above challange from a company I was being interviewed by and thought to share it for anyone it could maybe help. This at the face of it seems to be a simple javascript task, we will soon find out.</p>

                <h2>Steps taken to in completing this task:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Break down the question, it seems the question is asking two things.</li>
                    <li>The first ask is print the numbers 1 to 100 and while doing so look at three conditions</li>
                    <li>The second ask is consider three conditions which are replace multiples of the number three with "Fizz", replace multiples of the number five with "Buzz" and finally replace multiples of the numbers three and five with "FizzBuzz"</li>
                    <li>I started of with an easy win to get a for loop to console.log the numbers from 1 to 100</li>
                    <li>I than look to set the conditions to replace the multiples of three with Fizz and the multiples of five with Buzz.</li>
                    <li>Than looking to set the condition to replace the multiples of three and five with FizzBuzz.</li>
                    <li>A problem I faced was that the order or my conditonal if statements were important, a little troubleshooting was required.</li>
                    <li>I than added the results to a global variable which I intended to print to the HTML page</li>
                    <li>I created a button that when selected inserted the result into a div in the HTML</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Improvments</h2>
                <p>Given that I had more time I would of looked at the following. Maybe this is something I can come back to.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use sometime more up todate instead of a for loop, maybe a personal favorite would be a map method. See <a href="https://github.com/amarmohammed20/array-methods" target="_blank">HERE</a> for more detials. This would be option 2. Feel free to branch off and create more options.</li>
                        <li>Unit test could of been created to ensure that we are getting the desired result every time.</li>
                        <li>The css could be massivly improved and could be externalised in a .css sheet.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Option 1</h2>
                <p>This option is using a simplt for loop with some if conditions</p>
